Progress 95 - 99.9% roughly
 

# What's already been done?

The user interface has been mostly finished. psx-box is a project that will
incorporate mutliple emulation backends similar to how retroarch uses different
libretro cores. Currently we need help in taking the core library of PCSX-R and
building it into a Win32 DLL which can then be called from psx-box. Our other backend
PSXACT is still under active development and it may be some time before it's usable.


# Current state of the Emulator

Work on The U.I. is mostly finished. Still need to implemenet the backend stuff

# Building psx-box

Building psx-box is pretty straightforward. Just git clone open up the .sln file
and build. Nothing more, nothing less.
