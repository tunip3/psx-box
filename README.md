Progress 95 - 99.9% roughly
 

# What's already been done?

The user interface has been mostly finished. The core library which psx-box is based on
has already been written. The only thing left is just implementing the core library into
the main project possibly through p_invoke so the emulator can be called.


# Current state of the Emulator

Work on The U.I. is mostly finished. psx-box should be seeing a release soon.

# Building psx-box

Building psx-box is pretty straightforward. Just git clone open up the .sln file
and build. Nothing more, nothing less.
